KNN Classification Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks using Python.
It includes:
	•	Data preprocessing and feature scaling
	•	Model training with KNN
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
	•	Model evaluation with accuracy score and classification report

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (knn_classification.ipynb).

	2.	Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook knn_classification.ipynb


	3.	Run all cells to see:
	•	Data preprocessing
	•	KNN model training
	•	Hyperparameter optimization
	•	Model evaluation metrics
