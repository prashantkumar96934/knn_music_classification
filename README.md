KNN Classification Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks using Python.
It includes:
	•	Data preprocessing and feature scaling
	•	Model training with KNN
	•	Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
	•	Model evaluation with accuracy score and classification report

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (knn_classification.ipynb).
